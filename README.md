# Lab Files

The intention of this repository is to host files which serve as a solid baseline for commonly performed actions or resource deployments in the public cloud. The focus is currently on AWS and Cloudformation.

There are many documents available online for this type of thing, but frankly I've had to do this so many times that it seemed worth it to stop looking around for this stuff every time, and just have a decent repo where I know where everything is and what it does.

All Cloudformation related files are in the `cloudformation` directory, and Terraform work (when it exists) will go in a directory called... you guessed it: `terraform`. Similarly, if this repo expands into other config management or reusable scripts or code snippets, those should equally be separated for logical organization.

I'm happy to accept pull requests for improvements.
